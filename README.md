# 🔮 Pakistan 2030: A Data-Driven Forecast on Crime, Urban Migration, and Food Security

**Pakistan 2030** is a data science project that uses **Python** for data analysis and modeling and **R (Shiny)** for creating an interactive dashboard. It forecasts Pakistan’s future in three key domains: **crime rates**, **food security**, and **urban migration**, helping inform policy and decision-making.

## 📖 About the Project

Pakistan, with over 240 million people, faces severe economic, social, and environmental challenges—worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 floods. This project answers three strategic questions:

- **Which cities will be safest by 2030?**
- **Where will people live as urbanization accelerates?**
- **Will Pakistan have enough food to sustain its growing population?**

We employ:

- Python for data collection, cleaning, and modeling
- R Shiny for building an interactive, publicly accessible dashboard
- Statistical and machine learning techniques for forecasting
- A published eBook for deeper understanding
